[0.3.0]
    libdocscript: 0.3.0
    docsir: 0.3.0

    NOTE:

    For the long-term development, the goal of version 0.3 is to improve the 
    maintainability and extensibility of DocScript project.

    [libdocscript] and [docsir] have split as two subprojects in their 
    directory, [libdocscript] be a library to focus on the language 
    implementation, [docsir] be an interpreter front-end to offer the 
    interactive interface. [libdocscript] offers an interpreter implementation.

    Standard procedures that defined in docs/stdproc.txt now be called
    "built-in procedure". The new standard procedure will be optional for using.
    The new standard procedure is coming soon as a standalone project.

    In changelog, the tag [libdocscript] is about the code of libdocscript 
    subproject; the tag [docsir] about the feature and code of the docsir
    subproject; the tag [language] about the new language feature.

[0.2.0] - 2021-11-15

    NOTE:
    Because there has a plan to refactor [libdocscript] and [docsir] in next 
    version, to improve the human-readability and maintainbility. So some 
    changes that we planned are not available in the current version, and 
    we will release these changes in the next version.

    The macro feature should be the key point in the current version, but the 
    source code of [libdocscript] and [docsir] are hard to realize it, so this 
    feature will release in the next version.

    Added:
    - [docscript] Add new special forms: quote, unquote, quasiquote
    - [docscript] Add new syntax for the simplified special forms: 
                    quote, unquote, quasiquote

    Changed:
    - [docscript] New rule of name
    - [libdocscript] Comments will not be parsed as a syntax unit

    - [document] Remove document/grammar.txt
