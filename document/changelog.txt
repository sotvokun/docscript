[0.2.0] - 2021-11-15

    NOTE:
    Because there has a plan to refactor [libdocscript] and [docsir] in next 
    version, to improve the human-readability and maintainbility. So some 
    changes that we planned are not available in the current version, and 
    we will release these changes in the next version.

    The macro feature should be the key point in the current version, but the 
    source code of [libdocscript] and [docsir] are hard to realize it, so this 
    feature will release in the next version.

    Added:
    - [docscript] Add new special forms: quote, unquote, quasiquote
    - [docscript] Add new syntax for the simplified special forms: 
                    quote, unquote, quasiquote

    Changed:
    - [docscript] New rule of name
    - [libdocscript] Comments will not be parsed as a syntax unit

    Removed:
    - [document] Remove document/grammar.txt

    - [document] Add document/stdproc.txt for the next version and
